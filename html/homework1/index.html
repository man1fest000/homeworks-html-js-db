    <p>The Simpsons (often shortened to Simpsons) is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox
        Broadcasting Company. The main characters are a satire of a working-class family, consisting of Homer, Marge,
        Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, society, politics, and history.

    <p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[36] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the
        spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240
        pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have
        great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also
        serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.</p>
